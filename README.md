## why war?
i have always loved the card game war.  As a kid i would play this as my favorite card game.  So when we recived the challenge of making a simple browser game this was one of my first choices.
==============================


## Getting Started
link to play:
https://crice802.github.io/this-means-war/
=============================
how to play:
* shuffle one deck of 52 cards between two players
* players then draw and place the top card from deck into the war
* highest card wins the cards on the field
* if cards match there is a draw and This-Means-War ; each player places 3 cards down and compare the fourth card.
* who ever wins war keeps all cards played that round
* game ends when either player runs out of cards
